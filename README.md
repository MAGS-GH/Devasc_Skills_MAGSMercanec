## [Task 1 - GitHub Skills Test](/Devasc_Skills/Task-1-GitHub-Skills-Test)

> #### Task preparation => what preparation is necessary to perform the task? (short)

Not any, i have prior experience with GitHub and already downloaded the DEVASC VM

> Task implementation => what is the way you have implemented the task?

Follow the steps to create the repository where this Read.ME is

> Task troubleshooting => what were the problems encountered?

Not any problems during the process

> Task verification => proof of the quality of the result

All collectet here in GitHub and more details in the [Task 1](https://github.com/MAGS-GH/Devasc_Skills_MAGSMercanec/tree/main/Devasc_Skills/Task%201%20-%20GitHub%20Skills%20Test) folder

## [Task 2 - Ansible Skills Test](/Devasc_Skills/Task-2-Ansible-Skills)

> Task preparation => what preparation is necessary to perform the task? (short)

I needed to read up a bit on ansible and how the playbooks work - The examples on the URLS were not that easy to follow

> Task implementation => what is the way you have implemented the task?

I created a .ini file for my information (host, username, pwd and OS) - Then i created the Ansible file based on the example
I tried to run it and got some errors after debugging i got it to return ok=5!

> Task troubleshooting => what were the problems encountered?

I had some problems with my VM, not being able to see my router bc of some network settings!

> Task verification => proof of the quality of the result

There is a video and screenshots in this [folder](/Devasc_Skills/Task-2-Ansible-Skills/Video)

## [Task 3 - Docker](/Devasc_Skills/Task-3-Docker)

> Task preparation => what preparation is necessary to perform the task? (short)

I wanted to do this on my local windows PC, therefore i needed to install Docker Desktop. I had to read a little bit up about YAML again, because i did the Docker assigment before the Ansible

> Task implementation => what is the way you have implemented the task?

I made a Docker file and tried to run it on my local machine.

> Task troubleshooting => what were the problems encountered?

I have never worked with Bash on windows, and that ended being a bit of a hurdle.

> Task verification => proof of the quality of the result

There is a video and screenshots in this [folder](/Devasc_Skills/Task-3-Docker/Video)

## [Task 4 - Jenkins](/Devasc_Skills/Task-4-Jenkins)

> Task preparation => what preparation is necessary to perform the task? (short)

Install Jenkins on my Local machine (Windows) and connect it to Docker

> Task implementation => what is the way you have implemented the task?

I ran jenkins on my local machine with docker and used the result from Task 3

> Task troubleshooting => what were the problems encountered?

Had some trouble with Bash and generally naming of folders. There were some issues giving Jenkins access to Docker but i worked it out with help from google!

> Task verification => proof of the quality of the result

There is a video and screenshots in this [folder](/Devasc_Skills/Task-4-Jenkins/Video)

## [Task 5 - Rest API & Restconf](/Devasc_Skills/Task-5-Rest-API&Restconf)

> Task preparation => what preparation is necessary to perform the task? (short)

> Task implementation => what is the way you have implemented the task?

> Task troubleshooting => what were the problems encountered?

> Task verification => proof of the quality of the result

## [Task 6 - Webex Teams API](/Devasc_Skills/Task-6-Webex-Teams-API)

> Task preparation => what preparation is necessary to perform the task? (short)

> Task implementation => what is the way you have implemented the task?

> Task troubleshooting => what were the problems encountered?

> Task verification => proof of the quality of the result

## [Task 7 - Bash](/Devasc_Skills/Task-7-Bash)

> Task preparation => what preparation is necessary to perform the task? (short)

I needed to setup the V-router and the VM

> Task implementation => what is the way you have implemented the task?

I coded each section of the Python script to bash doing the same procedure

> Task troubleshooting => what were the problems encountered?

I had some errors due to the IP-address being wrong and not pointing at my VRouter

> Task verification => proof of the quality of the result

Can be seen in [Task-7-Result](./Devasc_Skills/Task-7-Bash/Video/)

## [Task 8 - unit testing](/Devasc_Skills/Task-8-unit-testing)

> => You do not have to complete a task about unit testing for this skills based assessment.

## [Task 9 - pyATS](/Devasc_Skills/Task-9-pyATS)

> => You do not have to complete a task about pyATS for this skills based assessment.

## [Task 10 - FILTERING DNAC RESPONSE DATA](/Devasc_Skills/Task-10-FILTERING-DNAC-RESPONSE-DATA)

> Task preparation => what preparation is necessary to perform the task? (short)

I had experience with Python from the exercised so did not need any preparation other than starting the VM

> Task implementation => what is the way you have implemented the task?

I looked at all the missing pieces and looked what was needed later in the code

> Task troubleshooting => what were the problems encountered?

I ran the code without the result multiple times, but debugged it until it gave the right answer

> Task verification => proof of the quality of the result
