I wanted to do this on my local windows PC, therefore i needed to install Docker Desktop. I had to read a little bit up about YAML again, because i did the Docker assigment before the Ansible

> Task implementation => what is the way you have implemented the task?

I made a Docker file and tried to run it on my local machine.

> Task troubleshooting => what were the problems encountered?

I have never worked with Bash on windows, and that ended being a bit of a hurdle.

> Task verification => proof of the quality of the result
